Feature: Track physical cost of running

    The amount of time that has been used (or ideally, the actual cost
    incurred) should be easily accessible.
    [Possible mechanisms: (1) Refer to AWS billing info; (2) use an API to
    extract stuff from AWS billing / CloudTrail; (3) have some custom
    cloud-independent approach -- probably (1) or (2)]

    Scenario: 
        # TODO: having trouble with this one because I feel like it depends
        # on the specific mechanism
